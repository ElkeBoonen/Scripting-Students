<ul><li><i><a href="/wiki/Fortnite:_Save_the_World" title="Fortnite: Save the World">Fortnite: Save the World</a></i> is a player-versus-environment <a href="/wiki/Cooperative_video_game" title="Cooperative video game">cooperative game</a>, with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various missions while avoiding the effects of an encroaching cataclysmic storm. The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Fortnite_Battle_Royale" title="Fortnite Battle Royale">Fortnite Battle Royale</a></i> is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players <a href="/wiki/Skydive" class="mw-redirect" title="Skydive">airdrop</a> from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map, and then scavenge for weapons, items, and resources while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters until the last player or team is alive.</li>
